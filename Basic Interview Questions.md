@3. what are Axios Interceptors?

--> Interceptors are functions that Axios calls before a request is sent or after a response is received. They act as middleware, allowing you to modify requests/responses globally.

@ What is CORS in browser?

--> CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that controls which websites are allowed to request resources from another website.

@ Preflight Request in API calling?

--> A Preflight Request is an automatic OPTIONS request that browsers send before the actual request to check if the server allows the cross-origin request.

Preflight is a browser security feature — it protects users but requires proper server configuration for cross-origin APIs




@40. Why we parse data from the API?

--> Because we get data in JSON format, and to make it usable we have to parse.
eg. res.json()
