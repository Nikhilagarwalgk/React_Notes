4. How do media queries work in responsive design?
   -> Media queries are a feature in CSS that let you apply styles only when certain conditions are true — such as screen width, device          type, orientation, or resolution. They are the core of responsive design, allowing websites to adapt their layout and appearance           across different devices.
      Eg:-
            @media (condition) {
              /* CSS rules go here */
            }

   🌍 Why Use Media Queries?
   
       -  Ensure content is legible and usable across devices.
       -  Avoid horizontal scrolling on mobile.
       -  Adapt layouts, font sizes, image scaling, and navigation design.
       -  Improve user experience and SEO (Google prioritizes mobile-friendly design).
