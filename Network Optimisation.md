@ Early Hints (HTTP 103) in Networking?

-> It gives hint for preload, prefetch, preconnect, ddns-prefetch.

@ A browser can handle 6-7 parallel request at a time.

@Compression - brotli/gzip?
--> Run at runtime and build time.

@ Caching:-
-> Cache policy (cache-control, expire etag, last-modifier)

Once we call a request, we have data. But if again we need the same data we call network then it will give the data from the cache.

@ What is service worker?
